# Temperature-Humidity-Monitoring
This project was assigned to me, Chrysovalantis Chatzimagkas and to my colleague Chen Wang by Thomas More College, Campus Geel.
The goal of this project was to create a prototype which could monitor humidity and temperature values in a fruit crop field and 
estimate if there is potential threat for nightfrost. THis would help farmers to take countermeasures against nightfrost and save
as many trees as possible in order to minimize the damage caused by nightfrost.
